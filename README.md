# Calculator App Demo

This is a simple demo of a standard calculator implemented as a single page web application.

The goal was to explore the implementation of standard calculator logic and use that as a basis for test-driven development.

## Tech Stack

Built with React and bootstrapped with Create React App.

Unit tests are written with Jest and React Testing Library.

To keep the application lightweight and functional, no other dependencies were used and minimal styling was applied with good old fashioned CSS.
